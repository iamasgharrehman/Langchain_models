## **LANGCHAIN**
LangChain is a powerful framework for building applications that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides modular components to make it easy to work with language models, integrate with various data sources, and build complex workflows. The key components of LangChain are:
1. Models
2. Prompt Templates
3. Chains
4. Memory
5. Agents
6. Tools

### LLM Models 
In this repo, we explored the langcahin and diffent type of models langchain supports to do multiple tasks. Langchain provides

1. Interface for interacting with various LLM providers (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face, Anthropic).
2. Supports different types of LLMs for text generation, completion, and conversation.
